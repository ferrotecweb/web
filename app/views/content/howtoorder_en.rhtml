<p>At Ferrotec,
we are committed to providing industry-leading customer service, and we
want to make it easy for you to select and purchase the Ferrofluidic
seal that you need. Using the web site, you can select the seal that
you need in one of three ways:</p>
</div>

<div id="div1">
  <p><span id="span1"><b> 1.</b></span><span id="span2"><b>Select a seal from our list of standard parts. </b><br /> Most of these components are commonly used and many are items that we typically carried in inventory.</span></p>
  <p><span id="span1"><b> 2.</b></span><span id="span2"><b>Configure a unique seal using our RFQ process. </b><br /> With over thirty years of producing specialized rotary seal solutions
for the world's most demanding applications, we understand how to match
a solution to your unique application and we have designed our online
RFQ form to streamline the process. When you ask us to prepare a quote
for your application, our engineers go to work, evaluating your
specification requirements. Depending on the complexity of the solution
that you need, your project may require several weeks of development
time, but our engineers are committed to ensuring that the Ferrotec
product you receive delivers the highest levels of performance and
reliability. Once you complete the RFQ form, a Ferrotec representative
will contact you to follow up and may discuss additional details with
you.</span></p>
